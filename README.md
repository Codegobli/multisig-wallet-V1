# Multi-signature Wallet

A secure, audited multi-signature wallet smart contract that enables collective fund management through multi-party approval mechanisms.

## üìã Overview

The Multi-signature Wallet is a Solidity smart contract that allows a group of owners to collectively manage cryptocurrency funds. Transactions require a configurable number of approvals before execution, providing enhanced security and governance for decentralized organizations, DAOs, and institutional crypto management.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-party Approval**: Configurable confirmation thresholds
- **Secure Transactions**: Requires multiple signatures for fund transfers
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable owner set and approval requirements
- **Contract Interactions**: Support for smart contract calls with calldata
- **Transparent Tracking**: Full visibility into transaction history and status
- **ETH Management**: Native Ethereum support with event tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

### Core Components

- **Owners Management**: Unique, non-zero address validation
- **Transaction Workflow**: Submit ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Execute
- **State Tracking**: Real-time confirmation and execution status
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive transaction lifecycle events

### Security Features

- Reentrancy protection
- Owner-only access controls
- Transaction existence validation
- Duplicate confirmation prevention
- Minimum confirmation requirements

## üìñ Usage

### Initialization

```solidity
// Deploy with 3 owners requiring 2 confirmations
address[] memory owners = [0x123..., 0x456..., 0x789...];
uint minConfirmations = 2;
MultisigWallet wallet = new MultisigWallet(owners, minConfirmations);
```

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Submit Transaction**
```solidity
wallet.submitTransaction(recipient, amount, data);
```

2. **Confirm Transaction**
```solidity
wallet.confirmTransaction(transactionIndex);
```

3. **Execute Transaction**
```solidity
wallet.executeTransaction(transactionIndex);
```

## üîß API Reference

### Core Functions

| Function | Description | Access |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `submitTransaction()` | Propose new transaction | Owners only |
| `confirmTransaction()` | Approve pending transaction | Owners only |
| `executeTransaction()` | Execute confirmed transaction | Owners only |
| `getTransaction()` | View transaction details | Public |
| `getTransactionCount()` | Get total transactions | Public |

### Events

- `SubmitTransaction`: New transaction proposal
- `ConfirmTransaction`: Owner confirmation added
- `ExecuteTransaction`: Transaction executed successfully
- `Deposit`: ETH received by contract

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Solidity ^0.8.20
- Hardhat/Foundry (for testing)
- Ethereum development environment

### Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
forge test

# Test specific functionality
forge test --match-test testSubmitTransaction
```

### Security

The contract includes:
- Modifier-based access control
- Input validation
- State transition guards
- Safe external calls

## üìä Gas Optimization

- Efficient storage packing
- Minimal state changes
- Optimized mapping structures
- Batch operations support

## üöÄ Deployment

### Constructor Parameters

- `_owners`: Array of owner addresses (non-zero, unique)
- `_minNumOfConfirmations`: Minimum confirmations required (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ owners.length)

### Verification

```bash
# Verify on Etherscan
forge verify-contract <address> MultisigWallet --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address[],uint256)" "[0x123...]" "2")
```
